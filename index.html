    <section id="how-it-works">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The AI-powered artificial heart continuously monitors the patient’s heart activity and adjusts in real-time to prevent cardiac events. It can potentially delay heart attacks by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Detecting early warning signs of irregularities</li>
            <li>Providing feedback to the patient and healthcare providers</li>
            <li>Adjusting medication dosages based on heart rhythms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once implanted, the device will operate using a battery that can be recharged wirelessly. The heart's AI will communicate with the device via Bluetooth, enabling seamless interaction.</p>
        <p>The device will also include a backup power supply to ensure functionality in case of unexpected battery failure. This dual-power mechanism enhances reliability, giving patients peace of mind.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the AI system will continually learn from each patient’s data, adapting to their unique cardiac patterns and ensuring optimal performance. This is a key differentiator from traditional heart devices, which may not offer personalized adjustments.</p>
