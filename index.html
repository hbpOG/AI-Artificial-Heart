        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This project aims to develop an AI-powered artificial heart that can monitor, learn, and adapt to heart rhythms. Our device is designed to address the urgent need for innovative solutions in the realm of cardiac care. With heart diseases being a leading cause of death globally, we strive to enhance patient outcomes and improve quality of life through cutting-edge technology.</p>

    <section id="technology">
        <h2>Technology Overview</h2>
        <p>The AI chip within our artificial heart is engineered to detect abnormalities in heart rhythms. It employs advanced machine learning algorithms that allow it to learn from the patient’s unique heart patterns, optimizing performance over time. The device is equipped with sensors that continuously monitor the heart's electrical activity, allowing for real-time adjustments to heart function, thereby ensuring that the heart maintains an optimal rhythm even in the presence of arrhythmias.</p>

    <section id="market">
        <h2>Market Need</h2>
        <p>Heart diseases are one of the most significant health issues faced globally. According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases are responsible for an estimated 17.9 million deaths each year, representing 31% of all global deaths. The increase in lifestyle-related diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, alongside a sedentary lifestyle, has resulted in a rising prevalence of heart attacks and related complications. This innovation addresses a critical need by offering a smart solution to heart management, potentially reducing mortality rates significantly.</p>

    <section id="how-it-works">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The AI-powered artificial heart continuously monitors the patient’s heart activity and adjusts in real-time to prevent cardiac events. The heart works by contracting and relaxing to pump blood throughout the body. This process is controlled by electrical impulses that trigger heartbeats. When these impulses are disrupted, it can lead to arrhythmias or even heart failure. Our device can potentially delay heart attacks by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Detecting early warning signs of irregularities:** The AI chip will analyze data from the heart's electrical activity to identify patterns that indicate potential problems.</li>
            <li>**Providing feedback to the patient and healthcare providers:** Real-time data transmission to medical professionals ensures that any anomalies are addressed promptly.</li>
            <li>**Adjusting medication dosages based on heart rhythms:** The device can communicate with healthcare systems to automatically adjust medications as needed, based on the patient's heart activity.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="mechanism-of-heart">
        <h2>Mechanism of the Heart</h2>
        <p>The human heart is a complex organ that functions as a pump to circulate blood throughout the body. It consists of four chambers: the right and left atria, and the right and left ventricles. Blood flows from the body into the right atrium, moves to the right ventricle, and is then pumped to the lungs for oxygenation. Oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium, flows into the left ventricle, and is pumped out to the rest of the body. This intricate process is regulated by a network of electrical impulses generated by the sinoatrial (SA) node, which serves as the natural pacemaker of the heart.</p>
        <p>Electrical signals travel through specialized pathways in the heart, causing the muscles to contract in a coordinated manner. Any disruptions in this electrical system can lead to conditions such as atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, or complete heart block, all of which can increase the risk of heart attack and other serious complications.</p>

    <section id="success-rate">
        <h2>Projected Success Rate</h2>
        <p>With our innovative technology, we project an 81% success rate within two years. This success will be measured not only by survival rates but also by the quality of life improvements for patients using the device. Our commitment is to provide patients with a reliable and life-saving solution, ensuring that they can lead active and fulfilling lives.</p>

    <section id="material-requirements">
        <h2>Material Requirements</h2>
        <p>The AI-powered artificial heart will require various materials, including biocompatible metals such as titanium for the housing, specialized polymers for insulation and cushioning, and advanced sensors made from silicon and other materials to monitor heart activity. The device will also need a reliable power source, which can be provided through batteries or other energy-harvesting technologies. Additionally, the AI chip will need to be programmed with algorithms that can learn and adapt based on patient data.</p>
        <p>These materials must meet strict regulatory standards for safety and efficacy to ensure that the artificial heart functions optimally and does not pose any risks to the patient.</p>
