        <div id="market-content" class="hidden">
            <p>Heart diseases are one of the most significant health issues faced globally. According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases are responsible for an estimated 17.9 million deaths each year, representing 31% of all global deaths. The increase in lifestyle-related diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, alongside a sedentary lifestyle, has resulted in a rising prevalence of heart attacks and related complications.</p>
            <p>Statistics show that individuals aged 40 and above are particularly at risk, with risk factors such as hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes playing significant roles in the onset of heart disease. Additionally, the emotional and psychological impacts of heart diseases cannot be understated, as they not only affect the individual but also their families and communities.</p>
            <p>This innovation addresses a critical need by offering a smart solution to heart management. Our AI-powered artificial heart can reduce mortality rates significantly by providing continuous monitoring and immediate intervention capabilities.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the increasing adoption of telemedicine and remote patient monitoring creates a favorable environment for the introduction of our product. As healthcare systems evolve, the demand for innovative and effective solutions for heart care is expected to grow, making this the right time for our product launch.</p>

        <h2 class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleVisibility('how-it-works-content')">How It Works</h2>
        <div id="how-it-works-content" class="hidden">
            <p>The AI-powered artificial heart continuously monitors the patient’s heart activity and adjusts in real-time to prevent cardiac events. The heart works by contracting and relaxing to pump blood throughout the body. This process is controlled by electrical impulses that trigger heartbeats. When these impulses are disrupted, it can lead to arrhythmias or even heart failure.</p>
            <p>Our device can potentially delay heart attacks by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Detecting early warning signs of irregularities:</strong> The AI chip will analyze data from the heart's electrical activity to identify patterns that indicate potential problems. For instance, the device can recognize variations in heart rate variability (HRV), which can be indicative of stress or impending cardiac issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Providing feedback to the patient and healthcare providers:</strong> Real-time data transmission to medical professionals ensures that any anomalies are addressed promptly. This allows for interventions that can mitigate risks before they escalate into serious complications.</li>
                <li><strong>Adjusting medication dosages based on heart rhythms:</strong> The device can communicate with healthcare systems to automatically adjust medications as needed, based on the patient's heart activity. This personalized approach to medication can improve treatment outcomes significantly.</li>

        <h2 class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleVisibility('mechanism-of-heart-content')">Mechanism of the Heart</h2>
        <div id="mechanism-of-heart-content" class="hidden">
            <p>The human heart is a complex organ that functions as a pump to circulate blood throughout the body. It consists of four chambers: the right and left atria, and the right and left ventricles. Blood flows from the body into the right atrium, moves to the right ventricle, and is then pumped to the lungs for oxygenation. Oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium, flows into the left ventricle, and is pumped out to the rest of the body. This intricate process is regulated by a network of electrical impulses generated by the sinoatrial (SA) node, which serves as the natural pacemaker of the heart.</p>
            <p>Electrical signals travel through specialized pathways in the heart, causing the muscles to contract in a coordinated manner. Any disruptions in this electrical system can lead to conditions such as atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, or complete heart block, all of which can increase the risk of heart attack and other serious complications.</p>
            <p>The heart's structure includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Atria:</strong> The two upper chambers that receive blood from the body and lungs.</li>
                <li><strong>Ventricles:</strong> The two lower chambers that pump blood out of the heart.</li>
                <li><strong>Valves:</strong> Structures that ensure blood flows in one direction through the heart.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Understanding the mechanics of the heart is crucial for developing an artificial heart that can replicate these functions while integrating AI technology for enhanced performance.</p>
