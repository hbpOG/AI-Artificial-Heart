# AI-Artificial-Heart
This project aims to develop an innovative AI-powered artificial heart that can monitor, learn, and adapt to the heart's rhythms. The heart will utilize advanced AI algorithms to detect abnormalities in heart rhythms and make instant adjustments to heart function, addressing critical needs in the field of cardiology.
